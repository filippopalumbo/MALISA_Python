Summary:
This Python script contains functions to perform various operations in order to calculate the 
following gait parameters.
- Step Lenght
- Stride Length
- Swing duration
- Stance duration
- Step Count -> Gait velocity
- Golden Ratio! (duration measure)
...

Purpose:
The purpose of this module is to provide a library of operations that can be imported and used
as the final computational step in the TUG analysis process. 

Contents:
list methods...

Usage:
Import this file into your Python script using 'import gait_parameter_calculations'.
Using the output from the script "state_machine_tug" (a csv-file containing a list of 
logged events from a TUG test), you can then call the functions provided in this file to 
calculate gait parameters.
